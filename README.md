# Parking Lot Application

## Overview
The Parking Lot Application is a Java-based system designed to simulate and manage a parking lot. It allows users to create a parking lot with a specified number of slots, park and remove cars, check the status of parking slots, and handle basic validations. The application includes a user interface styled with CSS for an enhanced user experience.

## Features
- **Initialize Parking Lot**: Create a parking lot with a user-defined number of slots.
- **Park a Car**: Assign a car to the nearest available parking slot.
- **Remove a Car**: Free up a slot by removing a parked car.
- **View Parking Status**: Display the current state of the parking lot, including occupied and free slots.
- **Input Validation**: Handle edge cases such as attempting to park in a full lot or removing a car from an invalid slot.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Core logic for parking lot operations (78.6% of the codebase).
- **CSS**: Styling for the user interface (21.4% of the codebase).
- (Optional) Additional libraries or frameworks for logging or testing, if included in the project.

## Getting Started
